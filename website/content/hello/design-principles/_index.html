<p>This course is designed with five principles in mind:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Start with cake</li>
<li>Cherish day one<br />
</li>
<li>Skip baby steps</li>
<li>Hide the veggies</li>
<li>Leverage the ecosystem</li>
</ol>

<h2>Start with cake</h2>
<p>Assuming you like chocolate and strawberries, which of the following images is
more likely to make you want to learn to bake a cake? I’m guessing the
answer is the image on the left: the cake.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/cake-ingredients.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The teaching philosophy of this course builds on this same idea. We first show
the students the end result, and then step back and teach the necessary
components. Specifically, instead of starting with data structures and functions,
we start data visualization. And not just a toy example, but a complex,
multivariate data visualization. Of course, we don’t want students feeling like…</p>

<p>The course goes starts out slow and emphasizes iteration. Students are initially
provided with lots of scaffolding, and then slowly we take away the scaffolding
until they are starting with a blank slate for their final projects.</p>

<div id="cherish-day-one" class="section level2">
<h2>Cherish day one</h2>
<p>Don’t spend the first day going through the syllabus in detail, aim to get
students to make their first meaningful data visualization in 10 minutes!
This might sound impossible, and it probably is, if you start by installing R,
and then RStudio, and then a bunch of packages, and making sure students have
Git working on their computer. You could spend a whole class (or more) on this
and not get to a point where every student has their local setup working in
an ideal fashion.</p>
<p>Instead, use cloud-based access to RStudio. This could be via RStudio Cloud or
an RStudio Server you set up locally at your institution. Find out more about
