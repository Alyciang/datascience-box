# (PART) Course content {-}

# Hello world {#hello-world}

Start the class off right, devoting more of the class time to introducing the 
course content instead of the course policies. And get students doing something 
with data as quickly as possible! A personal goal of mine is to get students to
produce their first data visualization within the first 10 minutes of class. The 
application exercise in this lecture is one way of achieving this goal.

I recommend starting off with a hands-on activity on Day One. Below are two options for such an activity. Note that one of them uses COVID-19 data and depending on where, when, and to whom you're teaching, working with these data might not be the most pleasant experience for all students. Please make sure to consider this before using this activity.

The RStudio Cloud workspace for Data Science Course in a Box project is [here](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/1655/join?access_code=5rdjusfIYF5iI0Gum2vNsBDLdtdnIEELBkf2EivK). You can join the workspace and play around with the sample application exercises.
