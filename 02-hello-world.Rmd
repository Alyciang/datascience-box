# (PART) Course content {-}

# Hello world {#hello-world}

Start the class off right, devoting more of the class time to introducing the 
course content instead of the course policies. And get students doing something 
with data as quickly as possible! A personal goal of mine is to get students to
produce their first data visualization within the first 10 minutes of class. The 
application exercise in this lecture is one way of achieving this goal.
